    <h2>Parts of a Trial</h2>
    <p>
      A typical case has two sides: the prosecution and the defense. The job of
      the prosecution is to do justice by arguing that the defendant (person who
      is on trial) has committed the crime that the defendant is accused of. The
      job of the defense is to show that their client, the defendant, is
      innocent. The two sides convince the judge or jury that their side is
      correct by delivering opening statements and closing arguments, which are
      speeches that frame the story or the case for the court, and calling up
      and questioning witnesses. The witnesses may be experts who were hired by
      either side (i.e. a handwriting expert hired to analyze handwritten
      evidence left on the scene), law enforcement officers who were involved in
      the invesigation (usually a detective or police officer on the
      prosecution), and regular people who are familiar with the victim or the
      defendant. The two sides may also introduce evidence, such as diagrams of
      the crime scene or physical evidence uncovered at the scene, which are
      often argued and analyzed by professional witnesses.

      <h3>Pretrial</h3>
      <p>
        The pretrial motion is only conducted in high school mock trial
        competitions. In a pretrial motion, the defense presents first. What the
        defense is arguing for changes from year to year with the case, but they
        will usually argue that a potential piece of evidence should be excluded
        due to some legal precedents. A legal precedent is a prior court case
        with a verdict that can be used as an example in future, similar cases.
        The two sides are given a list of possible precedent cases, and they
        must create a 4 minute statement with those regarding whether or not the
        evidence is permissible. During the pretrial motion, the judge may also
        ask questions about those precedents, so it's important that the
        pretrial attorney is familiar with all of the cases. After both sides
        have presented, each side gets a 2 minutes rebuttal, during which the
        judge may continue asking questions.
